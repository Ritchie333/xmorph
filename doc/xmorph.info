Description
***********

   xmorph is a digital image warping and dissolving program, also known
as a "morphing" program.  It runs under the X Window System.  The
primary use of xmorph is to generate and modify meshes which control
the shape of an image.  xmorph also has the capacity to dissolve images
together, and to generate a sequence of warped and dissolved images.
When this sequence is made into a movie, it is called a "morph".

   morph is a morphing program with no graphical user interface.  morph
performs image warping and dissolving but provides no means to create
or modify meshes.  The intent is to use morph after meshes have already
been generated with xmorph. Since morph has no GUI, it can be run as a
background job and can be distributed over many machines or processes.
This parallelization of the task can significanly speed up the image
processing.  morph can run on machines which have no display
whatsoever, and is therefore very portable.

   Both xmorph and morph use a library called libmorph which can be
used separately in the creation of other morphing programs.

   If imgfile names are provided on the command line, then those images
are loaded in.  Otherwise, xmorph generates images to be used in lieu
of images provided by the user.  Images may be loaded from menus within
xmorph.

   xmorph has built-in help pages that answer questions about the
details of its use.  Run xmorph and look at the online help for more
information.

Making movies
*************

   xmorph is NOT a tool for making movies.  xmorph is intended to be
used with OTHER tools for editting movies in the digital domain.  I do
not intend to add movie making abilities to xmorph.

   Here is a brief explanation of how to make a movie from the images
generated by xmorph:

   xmorph uses the TrueVision Targa (TGA) image file format.  You can
use PBMplus, netpbm, ImageMagick or some other program to convert Targa
to other still image formats.  (This will be necessary if, for example,
you use the Berkeley MPEG encoder or want to make an animated GIF.)
See, e.g., ftp://ikaros.fysik4.kth.se/pub/netpbm/.

   Use another program, such as Berkeley's mpeg_encode, or SGI's
dmconvert, or whirlgif to turn the sequence of images that xmorph
created into a single animation.  See, e.g.,
ftp://mm-ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/multimedia/mpeg/encode/.

   Use another program, such as mpeg_play, xanim or movieplayer, to
view the animation.  See, e.g.,
ftp://mm-ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/multimedia/mpeg/play/.

   There are plenty of other programs available for viewing movies.

   The only image file type currently supported is Truevision Targa
(TGA) but xmorph will load any type of Targa, such as 8-bit, 15-bit, or
16-bit colormapped or grayscale; 24-bit or 32-bit true color (with or
without alpha channel);  run- length encoded or uncompressed.

   Some versions of the program "xv" can not read xmorph's TGA image
files.  This is a bug in "xv", not in xmorph.

   Use image conversion programs (such as those listed in the SEE ALSO
section) to convert to and from TGA image files for use with xmorph and
morph .
