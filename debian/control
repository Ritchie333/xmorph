Description: digital image warping library
 libmorph warps images; the warping technique was invented and first used by
 Industrial Light and Magic, and is commonly called "morphing."
 libmorph also contains utilities to handle control meshes, that are
 line grids that are used to design an image warp.

Description:  digital image warp and morph (x11)
 Xmorph loads, saves, warps, and dissolves images, and loads, saves, creates,
 and manipulates control meshes which determine the warping.  The technique
 was invented and first used by Industrial Light and Magic, and is commonly
 called "morphing".
 .
 Xmorph uses the Targa image format exclusively.  Other software is needed to
 convert to other image formats or to movies.  (Due to a bug, Xmorph's images
 are unreadable by John Bradley's XV.)
 .
 xmorph is a GUI for libmorph, using the X Toolkit; the package also contains
 a text-only program called morph.
